🏥 Health Assistant AI
A supportive, educational AI health companion for general questions — not medical advice.
Health Assistant AI is a web-based application that allows users to ask health-related questions and receive warm, educational, and reassuring responses powered by the OpenAI Assistants API. The app is designed to provide clarity, emotional support, and helpful context — without diagnosing conditions or giving medical treatment instructions.

Emotional reassurance
Possible factors in non-diagnostic terms
Encouragement to seek medical care when appropriate
